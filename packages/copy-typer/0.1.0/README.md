# Copy Typer

**Copy Typer** is a simple [Espanso](https://espanso.org/) package that types out the content currently in your clipboard when you use the `:paste` trigger. This is especially useful in environments where the usual `Ctrl + V` paste functionality is not available, such as Linux terminals in browsers.

## Usage

- Type `:paste` in your terminal or any text input to insert the content of your clipboard.
